This file contains additional information about the exam to help clarify some
questions.

** main() **

- Make sure that you update the main() function so that it uses both of the
  functions (copyToArray, copyNonLeaf).
- Make sure that the output of your program is clear so I can tell where you
  are printing the output of each function.
- Make sure you do any memory cleanup that you need to do to avoid memory
  leaks.

** copyToArray(node* root,int intArray[]) **

- You don't know the size of the array. You have to dynamically allocate the
  array. You will also need to make sure that you deallocate the array in your
  main when you're done printing the array. You need to do this to avoid
  memory leaks.

** copyNonLeaf(node* root, node*& newRoot) **

- You will be creating a new tree that has newRoot as the root. You will have
  to dynamically create this new tree. 
- The new tree will contain all of the non-leaf nodes from the original
  tree. For example, if the original tree is:
  
      5
     / \
    3   8
   / \ / \
  1  46   9

  The new tree will be:

      5
     / \
    3   8

- Make sure that the new tree is a BST.
